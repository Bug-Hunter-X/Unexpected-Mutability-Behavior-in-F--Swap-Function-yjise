This repository demonstrates a common misunderstanding in F# regarding mutable variables within functions.  The initial `bug.fs` file shows a function attempting to swap two mutable variables, but it fails to produce the expected result. The solution, `bugSolution.fs`, provides a corrected version that correctly swaps the variables. This example highlights the importance of understanding how mutability and variable scope interact in F#.
